  "description" : "Something that's been missing from Starbound since the game's release was interactivity between fire weapons and the meat that monsters drop. \n\nThis sounded like a simple thing to fix. Just add a loot table for fire, right? \n[b]Wrong.[/b]\n\nThere are [b]12 different types of fire damage[/b] in vanilla Starbound! \n(And \"heat\" damage, which also counts, I think. )\n\nI decided to make each fire damage type link to a loot table for cooked meat for each monster type in the game (where appropriate - some monsters don't drop meat). While I was looking through the loot tables for all the different monsters I also fixed other mistakes or inconsistencies that I found.\n\n[b]This mod does not modify the drop rates for alien meat.[/b]\nAlien meat, raw poultry, etc will still drop at the normal rates. \nIf you used a fire weapon, the drop will be cooked.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h2]Crispy makes the following changes:[/h2][list]\n[*] Generated flying, swimming, and ground monsters drop appropriately cooked meat when defeated with fire weapons\n[*] Generated swimming monsters now have hunting loot tables\n[*] Unique monster loot tables have been updated to support the many fire damage types\n[*] Farming monster loot tables have been updated to support the many fire damage types\n[*] Several missing hunting tables have been added\n[*] Rare monster variants now drop appropriate loot items\n[*] All of the vanilla fish types that you can catch with a rod will now drop cooked fish if you immolate them\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Crispy adds support for the following fire damage types:[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] fire\n[*] fireaxe\n[*] firebarrier\n[*] firebow\n[*] firebroadsword\n[*] firedagger\n[*] firehammer\n[*] fireplasma\n[*] fireplasmabullet\n[*] fireplasmashotgun\n[*] firespear\n[*] flamethrower\n[*] heat\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Crispy also adds hunting loot tables for the following damage types:[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] electricbow\n[*] icebow\n[*] poisonbow\n[/list]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h2]Additional details:[/h2]\n\nThe rare monster variants shared their loot tables with their common counterparts. This would occasionally create situations where an Electric Snaunt would drop a Venom Sample instead of a Static Cell, etc. All of these inconsistencies have been corrected and elemental monsters can now drop the appropriate elemental crafting material.\n\nParasprite's hunting table has been corrected to improve the action figure drop rate instead of reduce it. I am pretty sure this was a developer oversight.\n\nHunting loot tables for the Cosmic Intruder, Nutmidgeling, Poison Nutmidgeling, and several other monsters have been added where they were missing from vanilla.\n\nMonopuses have had their alien meat drop replaced with raw or cooked tentacle where appropriate.\n\nThe electricbow, firebow, icebow, and poisonbow damage types are for elemental crossbow bolts. All of these damage types now appropriately link to a hunting loot table. The firebow type in particular will also drop cooked items from the hunting table.\n\n[b]Crispy only changes the drops for vanilla monsters.[/b] If you want monsters from other mods to also drop cooked meat, ask the creators of those mods to make the same changes to their monsters.\n\nIf your mod adds other fire damage types, feel free to let me know what those are and I can add them to the vanilla creatures without hurting anything. You'll still need to fix the loot tables for your own custom monsters, though.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nThis project took several days and involved tedious editing of thousands of lines of text in multiple loot table files.\n\nPlease let me know in the comments if you find any mistakes!",
